<!-- The script below runs a computation using a Tensor data
structure from Tensorflow.js.  The computation
runs on the computer's GPU (Graphics Processing Unit),
which is much faster than running on the CPU.  The speed
difference is irrelevant for this tiny example, but will
become critical for compute-intense applications like
training neural networks. -->
